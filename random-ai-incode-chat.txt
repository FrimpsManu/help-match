# Hey Copilot, what does csrf_exempt do in Django?
# : csrf_exempt is a decorator provided by Django to exempt a view from the CSRF protection mechanism. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection is a security feature in Django that prevents unauthorized requests from being made on behalf of a user. By using csrf_exempt, the view is allowed to receive POST requests without requiring a CSRF token, which can be useful for certain types of API endpoints or views that don"t need CSRF protection. However, it"s important to use csrf_exempt carefully and only for views that are safe from CSRF attacks.
# Is there a way I can send a post request without using csrf_exempt?
# : Yes, you can send a POST request without using csrf_exempt by including the CSRF token in the request. In Django, you can include the CSRF token in the request headers or as a hidden input field in the form data. This ensures that the request is authenticated and protected against CSRF attacks. However, if you have a specific use case where CSRF protection is not needed or is handled differently, you can use csrf_exempt to bypass the CSRF protection for that particular view.
# I guess it"s faster this way...
# : Yes, using csrf_exempt can simplify the development process and make it faster for certain views that don"t require CSRF protection. However, it"s important to be cautious and ensure that the views exempted from CSRF protection are safe from CSRF attacks. Always consider the security implications before using csrf_exempt in your Django views.

# Explain ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS
# :param ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS: A dictionary containing the rate limits to apply to the different views.
# : type ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS: dict
# : default ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS: {}
# : example ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS: {
# :     "register": "5/h",
# :     "login": "5/m",
# : }
# What does the example do?
# : The example sets the rate limit for the register view to 5 requests per hour and the rate limit for the login view to 5 requests per minute.
# : what does that mean
# : The rate limit for the register view is set to 5 requests per hour, which means that a user can only make 5 requests to the register view in an hour.
# okay
