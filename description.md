# Help Match Repository Overview

The Help Match repository is a Django-based web application designed to connect users who need help with those who can provide assistance. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its features and functionality:

## 1. User Authentication
- The app uses **Django Allauth**, a popular Django package for authentication.
- Users can securely **sign up**, **log in**, and **log out**.
- Includes **user account management**, with password reset capabilities.
- Users are identified by their role in the system (e.g., someone needing help or someone offering help).

## 2. Help Matching System
- The main feature is the **help matching system**, where users can either request help or offer help.
- Users describe their needs or abilities in specific categories, and the system matches them with other users who fit the description.
- The matching process uses **tags** and **categories** (e.g., "looking for coding help," "willing to tutor," etc.).
- Backend logic ensures the right users are matched based on their descriptions.

## 3. Real-time Chat with Django Channels
- The app uses **Django Channels** to support **real-time interactions**.
- **WebSockets** are used for real-time messaging, allowing users who have been matched to communicate instantly without needing to refresh the page.
- This feature enhances user engagement by enabling direct communication between matched users.

## 4. Game-like Interaction
- The app includes a **gamified system**, where users play a game to catch their helper who can avoid those who need help by playing too.

## 5. Integration with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5
- The application integrates with **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5** API to process user descriptions and match them to specific help channels

## 6. Django and Other Technologies Used

## 7. Deployment and Setup
